### "Throwing" reflections

* Buggy code became easier to reason about
* Find bad ("unrecoverable") errors at the point that they occur
* Better than nothing, but often good mostly as a memo to fix the error case
  * Or if you have no idea how the code could have gone wrong
  * Useful for "post-" and "pre-conditions"
* May have to wrap in `try`/`catch` at some point -- where?
  * Have to remember to wrap in `try`/`catch`
