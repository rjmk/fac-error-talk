* Works for async code (synchronous too!)
* We can write general code to work with these errors ... but maybe not that easily
* People who write node are used to it

Let's write a function that takes any callback and logs any errors using `Log` (given)

```
function addLogs (cb) {

}

addLogs(function (err, data) { console.log("I'm running")})(new Error("hello!"), null)
```

```



















function Log (err) {
  console.log("Hoorah for logging!", err)
}
```
