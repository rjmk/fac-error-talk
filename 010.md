## Step 2: Passing the error up

* We don't need to do anything with the error yet, we just can't pretend it doesn't exist
* `getUser` already had a way of telling us about errors. What would adapting that look like?

```
function getUserRecord (id) {
  var user = getUser(id)
  // Let's go!
}

console.log(getUserRecord(4))
```

```



























function getUser (id) {
  return [ "error", "Too rainy :(" ]
}
```
