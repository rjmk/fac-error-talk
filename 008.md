### Trying to recover

We can't have this kind of crazy behaviour and unexpected crashing.
But we'd also like to avoid crashing if the program can still do something sensible.

What about returning an "empty value" (`{}`) or a "sensible default" (an example user)?

This leaves us:
  * When running ...
    * Having to check for fields (possibly still crashing)
    * Unsure whether we got the default because we asked for it or because it defaulted
  * When coding ...
    * Having to guess all the cases where our function will be used so we can work out the default
