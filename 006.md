"This is a talk on errors, Rafe, you can't fool me so easily!"

Errors look like `[ "Error" /*, Error Message */ ]`

So that means ...

```
var user = {
  name: "There was a terrible problem!",
  age: undefined,
  favouriteLang: undefined,
  dateRetrieved: new Date
}
```
```
console.log("Hi there,", user.name + "!")

console.log("You were", user.age, "on", user.dateRetrieved.toString())
console.log("That means you were born in (roughly) ...")

console.log(new Date(
  user.dateRetrieved - new Date(user.age * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
).getFullYear())
```
```
function logger (x) {
  return function () {
    console.log(x)
  }
}

var fns = [ logger(1), logger("hi"), logger("...") ]

fns[Math.min(3, user.age) - 1]() // Hey, it could happen!
```
